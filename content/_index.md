I am a doctoral candidate in the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Berkeley. My research focuses on the political and social dimensions of public education policymaking, especially regarding market-oriented education reforms. I am interested in how education policymaking and advocacy processes impact educational equity and democracy, particularly among nondominant communities. My dissertation compares the constitution and mobilization of stakeholder coalitions supporting charter schools organized around different political, ideological, and philosophical perspectives, and how coalition-building processes may advance or constrain racial and socioeconomic equity and democratic participation.

Prior to pursuing doctoral studies, I taught middle and high school English New York City and worked as a policy research assistant at Teachers College, Columbia University. I received my BA in English and Creative Writing from Barnard College, my MS in Teaching (Adolescent English) from Pace University, and my MA in Education Policy from UC Berkeley.
